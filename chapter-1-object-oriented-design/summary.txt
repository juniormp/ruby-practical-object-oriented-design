# If an application lives long enough, that is, if it succeeds, its biggest problem will become that of dealing with change. Arranging code to efficiently accommodate change is a matter of design. The most visible elements of design are principles and patterns, but unfortunately even applying principles correctly and using patterns appropriately does not guarantee the creation of an easy-to-change application.
# OO metrics expose how well an application follows OO design principles. Bad metrics strongly imply future difficulties; however, good metrics are less helpful. A design that does the wrong thing might produce great metrics but may still be costly to change.
